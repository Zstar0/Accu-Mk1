# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-19)

**Core value:** Streamlined lab workflow: guide tech through sample prep step-by-step with auto weight capture — stock prep, dilution, ready for HPLC injection.
**Current focus:** v0.11.0 — New Analysis Wizard, Phase 1

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (DB Models and Calculation Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-19 — Roadmap created, requirements mapped, ready to plan Phase 1

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Use `Decimal` arithmetic from first formula — no retrofitting allowed
- Store only raw weights in DB; recalculate all derived values on demand
- ScaleBridge as singleton on `app.state` (not per-request connection)
- SSE via `StreamingResponse` (existing codebase pattern — 4 endpoints already using it)
- Re-weigh inserts new record + sets `is_current=False` on old (audit trail preserved)
- SCALE_HOST env var controls scale mode; absent = manual-entry mode (no crash)
- Phase 2 is hardware-dependent: confirm Ethernet module, IP, and TCP port on physical balance before coding

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 (Scale Bridge): requires physical balance access — confirm Ethernet module installed, get static IP and configured TCP port before coding begins
- Phase 5 (SENAITE): requires live instance access — fetch a known sample with `?complete=yes` to identify peptide name and declared weight field names before building search UI

### Pending Todos

None.
