# Changelog

## v0.12.0 — 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Receive Sample wizard** — new 2-step intake workflow (Samples → Sample Details) for receiving samples from SENAITE
  - Step 1: Browse due samples with sortable table, search, and selection
  - Step 2: Dense single-card layout showing all SENAITE sample details, analytes, and collapsible COA information
  - **Photo capture** with live camera preview, guide overlay, auto-enhance (levels, contrast, white balance), and device selection
  - **Check-In to SENAITE** — uploads sample image, adds operator remarks, and transitions sample to "received" state in one click
  - "Check In Another Sample" button after successful receive to quickly process the next sample
- **`POST /wizard/senaite/receive-sample`** backend endpoint — performs image upload, remarks update, and workflow transition with CSRF handling and post-transition verification
- **SENAITE Dashboard** — embedded SENAITE view accessible from AccuMark Tools sidebar
- **Software Updates** section in Preferences — check for updates, download, and relaunch from within the app
- **Sidebar nav item** for Intake section with Receive Sample entry
- **Hash-based navigation** utility for SENAITE dashboard routing

### Changed

- **Docker Compose** — backend port now exposed directly (`ports` instead of `expose`) for easier local development
- **Tauri window lifecycle** — main window close now exits the full process (prevents hidden quick-pane window from keeping app alive)

### Fixed

- **SENAITE UID lookup** — backend now uses uppercase `UID` query parameter (SENAITE silently ignores lowercase `uid`, returning wrong sample)
- **SENAITE attachment upload** — `Analysis` form field set to `""` instead of literal "Attach to Sample" text (which caused 500 APIError)
- **CSRF token freshness** — always re-fetches CSRF token before workflow transition to prevent stale-token failures
- **Workflow state guard** — skip transition for samples already past `sample_due` state instead of failing

## v0.11.0 — 2026-02-19

## v0.10.0 — 2026-02-13

### Added

- **In Progress tab** in Order Explorer — shows samples awaiting COA publication with sample name, identity, lot code, SENAITE ID, and delivery/COA status
- **COA Explorer** — new standalone view for browsing COA generations across all orders, accessible from the sidebar
- **`sample_results` field** now returned from backend explorer orders endpoint, fixing the always-empty "Sample IDs" column in the orders table
- **`navigateToOrderExplorer()`** store action for cross-section navigation to Order Explorer
- **Integration Service network** added to Docker Compose for backend-to-Integration Service connectivity
- **`INTEGRATION_SERVICE_URL`** env var for proxying explorer requests
- **Per-peptide resync button** in Peptides list — re-imports a single peptide's calibration files from SharePoint without running a full import
- **`GET /hplc/peptides/{id}/resync/stream`** backend SSE endpoint for single-peptide resync

### Changed

- **Reference RT** now always updates from the active curve's retention times when switching curves via Set Active, full import, or single-peptide resync

- **Ingestions tab renamed** to "COAs Published" across all UI text (tab, loading, error, and empty states)
- **Order Explorer subtitle** updated from "Browse orders and ingestions" to "Browse orders and COAs"
- **AccuMark Tools** section refactored to route between Order Explorer and COA Explorer sub-sections

### Fixed

- **Sample IDs column** in orders table now shows SENAITE IDs (was always empty because `sample_results` wasn't queried from the database)
- **Set Active button** in Calibration Panel was silently failing due to wrong auth token localStorage key
