# Changelog

## v0.14.0 — 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Inline editing for Sample Details** — click any editable field value to edit it in-place with save/cancel controls
  - New `EditableField` and `EditableDataRow` components with optimistic updates, loading spinners, and toast notifications
  - Editable fields: Order #, Client Sample ID, Client Lot, Date Sampled, Declared Qty, analyte peptide names, analyte declared quantities, and all COA branding fields (company name, website, email, address, verification code, logo URL, chromatograph BG URL)
  - Keyboard support: Enter to save, Escape to cancel, focus management on edit mode entry
  - Custom `onSave` prop allows reuse with non-SENAITE backends (used for additional COA configs)
- **Additional COAs section** in Sample Details — displays additional branded COA configurations from the Integration Service
  - Collapsible per-COA cards showing company name, status badge, and branding details
  - Inline editing of all additional COA fields (company name, website, email, address, logo URL, chromatograph BG URL)
  - Image thumbnails for logo and chromatograph background alongside text fields
  - `PATCH /explorer/additional-coas/{config_id}` backend proxy for updating additional COA branding
- **SENAITE field update endpoint** — `POST /wizard/senaite/samples/{uid}/update` proxies field writes to SENAITE
  - JSON-first strategy with form-encoded fallback to handle both extension fields and isDecimal-type fields
- **URL left-truncation** — `truncateStart` prop on editable fields shows the filename end of long URLs instead of the domain

### Fixed

- **Extension field saves now persist** — Logo URL and Chromatograph BG URL writes previously returned false success (SENAITE silently ignored form-encoded extension fields). Fixed with JSON-first approach that falls back to form-encoded on 400 errors.

## v0.13.0 — 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Sample Details page redesign** — complete UI overhaul of the SENAITE sample detail view
  - Two-column grid layout: sample info & order details on the left, analytes & COA info on the right
  - Analysis profile theming with color-coded chips (Peptide/violet, Endotoxin/teal, Sterility-PCR/rose)
  - Row-level status tinting in the analyses table (colored left border + subtle background per state)
  - New table columns: Retested indicator and Result Captured date
  - Integrated progress bar showing verified/pending analysis completion percentage
  - Collapsible sections with proper accessibility (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`)
  - Remarks rendered as sanitized HTML via DOMPurify (supports links, bold, italic)
- **Deep-linkable sample details** — hash navigation now supports query parameters (`#dashboard/sample-details?id=PB-0056`) for direct links to specific samples
- **Richer SENAITE analysis data** — backend returns `sort_key`, `captured` date, `retested` flag, and resolves selection-type results through SENAITE's ResultOptions mapping

### Fixed

- **SENAITE link follows active environment** — "Open in SENAITE" link now dynamically resolves based on the active API environment profile (local Docker vs production) instead of being fixed at build time
- **Docker env file separation** — `.env.docker` now targets local testing (SENAITE at localhost:8080); production builds use `--build-arg ENV_FILE=.env.docker.prod`
- **Sample ID normalization** — backend uppercases and trims sample IDs before SENAITE lookup

### Infrastructure

- Dockerfile accepts `ENV_FILE` build arg for switching between local and production env files
- docker-compose.yml passes `ENV_FILE` arg (defaults to `.env.docker`)

## v0.12.0 — 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Receive Sample wizard** — new 2-step intake workflow (Samples → Sample Details) for receiving samples from SENAITE
  - Step 1: Browse due samples with sortable table, search, and selection
  - Step 2: Dense single-card layout showing all SENAITE sample details, analytes, and collapsible COA information
  - **Photo capture** with live camera preview, guide overlay, auto-enhance (levels, contrast, white balance), and device selection
  - **Check-In to SENAITE** — uploads sample image, adds operator remarks, and transitions sample to "received" state in one click
  - "Check In Another Sample" button after successful receive to quickly process the next sample
- **`POST /wizard/senaite/receive-sample`** backend endpoint — performs image upload, remarks update, and workflow transition with CSRF handling and post-transition verification
- **SENAITE Dashboard** — embedded SENAITE view accessible from AccuMark Tools sidebar
- **Software Updates** section in Preferences — check for updates, download, and relaunch from within the app
- **Sidebar nav item** for Intake section with Receive Sample entry
- **Hash-based navigation** utility for SENAITE dashboard routing

### Changed

- **Docker Compose** — backend port now exposed directly (`ports` instead of `expose`) for easier local development
- **Tauri window lifecycle** — main window close now exits the full process (prevents hidden quick-pane window from keeping app alive)

### Fixed

- **SENAITE UID lookup** — backend now uses uppercase `UID` query parameter (SENAITE silently ignores lowercase `uid`, returning wrong sample)
- **SENAITE attachment upload** — `Analysis` form field set to `""` instead of literal "Attach to Sample" text (which caused 500 APIError)
- **CSRF token freshness** — always re-fetches CSRF token before workflow transition to prevent stale-token failures
- **Workflow state guard** — skip transition for samples already past `sample_due` state instead of failing

## v0.11.0 — 2026-02-19

## v0.10.0 — 2026-02-13

### Added

- **In Progress tab** in Order Explorer — shows samples awaiting COA publication with sample name, identity, lot code, SENAITE ID, and delivery/COA status
- **COA Explorer** — new standalone view for browsing COA generations across all orders, accessible from the sidebar
- **`sample_results` field** now returned from backend explorer orders endpoint, fixing the always-empty "Sample IDs" column in the orders table
- **`navigateToOrderExplorer()`** store action for cross-section navigation to Order Explorer
- **Integration Service network** added to Docker Compose for backend-to-Integration Service connectivity
- **`INTEGRATION_SERVICE_URL`** env var for proxying explorer requests
- **Per-peptide resync button** in Peptides list — re-imports a single peptide's calibration files from SharePoint without running a full import
- **`GET /hplc/peptides/{id}/resync/stream`** backend SSE endpoint for single-peptide resync

### Changed

- **Reference RT** now always updates from the active curve's retention times when switching curves via Set Active, full import, or single-peptide resync

- **Ingestions tab renamed** to "COAs Published" across all UI text (tab, loading, error, and empty states)
- **Order Explorer subtitle** updated from "Browse orders and ingestions" to "Browse orders and COAs"
- **AccuMark Tools** section refactored to route between Order Explorer and COA Explorer sub-sections

### Fixed

- **Sample IDs column** in orders table now shows SENAITE IDs (was always empty because `sample_results` wasn't queried from the database)
- **Set Active button** in Calibration Panel was silently failing due to wrong auth token localStorage key
